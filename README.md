### Abstract

> The Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model has emerged as the standard framework for modern cosmology. It successfully accounts for the large-scale structure of the Universe, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and the late-time accelerated expansion. Within this paradigm, a period of accelerated expansion---inflation---in the very early Universe provides the seeds for primordial perturbations that subsequently evolve into the structures observed today. Despite its empirical success, the microphysical origin of inflation remains unknown, and the inflationary sector is typically modeled by simple scalar-field potentials. This paper explores a falsifiable inflationary scenario where a log-periodic modulation of the quadratic potential, motivated by the principle of Discrete Scale Invariance (DSI), induces oscillatory features in the primordial spectrum.

### Key Features of the Model

*   **Theoretical Economy:** Introduces minimal modifications to the standard inflationary potential.
*   **Falsifiable Predictions:** Generates a distinct, log-periodic signature in the CMB and large-scale structure, testable by next-generation surveys (CMB-S4, Euclid, SKA).
*   **Fractal Philosophy:** Suggests a novel perspective where features in the primordial spectrum may be a direct imprint of a fundamental discrete scaling symmetry in the early Universe.
