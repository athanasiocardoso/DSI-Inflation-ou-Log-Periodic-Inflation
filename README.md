### Abstract

> We revisit Starobinsky plateau inflation with a small log-periodic (discrete scale invariance, DSI) modulation of the potential and compute the induced oscillatory features in the primordial curvature spectrum. Our main aim is to introduce DSI as a novel symmetry principle in inflationary cosmology: discrete rescalings of the inflaton field lead naturally to log-periodic modulations, providing a controlled framework to explore new physics beyond standard slow roll. Working consistently to first order in the modulation amplitude A â‰ª 1, we correct common pitfalls in the literature and establish DSI as a theoretically consistent and observationally constrained extension of plateau inflation, highlighting it as a concrete target for upcoming CMB and 21cm surveys.

### Key Advancements in this Version

*   **Focus on a Realistic Model:** Applies the DSI principle to the observationally-favored Starobinsky inflation model, moving from a toy model to a phenomenologically relevant scenario.
*   **Increased Rigor:** Provides corrected first-order formulas for key inflationary parameters and residuals, addressing common pitfalls in the literature and ensuring a more robust theoretical framework.
*   **Concrete Observational Targets:** Establishes DSI as a well-defined and falsifiable target for next-generation surveys like CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and 21cm experiments.
