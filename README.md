### Abstract

> We revisit Starobinsky plateau inflation with a small log-periodic (discrete scale invariance, DSI) modulation of the potential and compute the induced oscillatory features in the primordial curvature spectrum... (Cole aqui o novo resumo completo).

### Key Advancements in this Version

*   **Focus on a Realistic Model:** Applies the DSI principle to the observationally-favored Starobinsky inflation model.
*   **Increased Rigor:** Provides corrected first-order formulas for key inflationary parameters and residuals, addressing common pitfalls in the literature.
*   **Concrete Observational Targets:** Establishes DSI as a theoretically consistent and observationally constrained framework, highlighting it as a target for upcoming CMB and 21cm surveys.
